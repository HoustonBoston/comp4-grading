# Purpose
This is to make my life easier grading other students' work. Containers are powerful because they offer isolation. Any risky packages can cause headaches down the line, so an isolated environment is needed.

# Dependencies needed:
podman, podman-compose, SFML3.0

## Installation:
``` sudo apt update
    sudo apt install podman podman-compose
```

## Installation for SFML:
Visit this link: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/3.0.2/

and download GCC- Linux 64-bit, and put it in the directory where all Dockerfiles and podman-compose files exist for this project.
